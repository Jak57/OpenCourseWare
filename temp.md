### Problem Setter

Name:  **<(Write your name here...)>**         
Registration # **<(Write your registration number here...)>**            
Session: *<(Write your session here...)>*            
GitHub Username: *<(Write your GitHub username here...)>*               
Cell: *<(Write your mobile number(s) here...)>*              
Email: *<(Write your email id(s) here...)>*  

### Problem Details

Problem Slug: **<A short name of the problem containing hyphen(s) instead of space(s)>**    
<small>*[A slug is the short name of a problem that is used in the contest to identify a problem uniquely and easily.]*</small>    
Problem Topic: **<Comma separated broad domains/topics should be here>**    
Problem Difficulty: **<high/medium/low>**     
<small>*[The problem difficulty has 3 levels, i.e. high/medium/low. This difficulty is solely determined by the setter.]*</small>    

Any Specific Domain Knowledge Needed? : **<Yes/No - If yes, then mention the Domain(s) below overwriting the 'None'>**    
Required Domain Knowledge: **None**    

Multiple Valid Answer? : **<Yes/No - If yes, then provide the file validator.cpp below>**    
<small>*[If a problem has multiple correct solution, then it needs special attention. Not all online judges support this type of problem. This kind of problem requires an additional program named validator to verify the answer. The validator program may vary judge to judge but in our judge, it takes the output of the contestant's solution and gives output like "AC","PE","WA".]*</small>    
Special Case Problem? : **<Yes/No - If yes, then provide the file validator.cpp below>**    
<small>*[A special case problem is a problem where it needs special attention. Suppose, a solution might vary in  precision and judges do not want to give a WA for the small precision problem. Example: The judge's output of a problem is 3.1416, the contestant's output is 3.1415 and judge does not intend to limit him from WA for this. Then judge writes a validator program and gives output. Remember, in some contests, special judge problem means judge would manually see your solution and give verdict manually.]*</small>    
Validator Program: **None**   

#### Problem Statement: [statement.md](statement.md)    
#### Solution of the Problem: [solution.cpp](solution.cpp)

#### Checker: [checker.cpp](checker.cpp)    
<small>*[Checker is a program file that takes the input for a problem and checks whether the input set is valid according to the description or not. It should print something affirmative and return 0 if the input set is valid. Otherwise it would print something negative and return 1. All the tests in the test set should go through this checker.]*</small>    

#### Task Briefing:      
<small>*[The main task of the problem excluding story. It briefs what the problem actually asked and how if necessary.]*</small>    

<Start your Task Briefing here ... >

#### Editorials: [editorials.md](editorials.md)    
<small>*[A short brief on how to solve this problem. If there are multiple ways to solve this problem, state all of them in your knowledge.]*</small>    

How many test case(s)? : **<(Number of tests in the set)>**

### Test Files:      
<small>*[Add as much test files as you need.]*</small>
